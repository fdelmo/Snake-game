# Snake game

### Author: Ferran del Moral MÃ©ndez

This project was used by the author as means to practice object oriented programming.

In the future, there are plans to implement a Deep Learning bot able to play the game and maybe even possibly a 2 player version of it.

For now the project is to be run locally. But might be uploaded as a web-app in the future if time and results allow it.
